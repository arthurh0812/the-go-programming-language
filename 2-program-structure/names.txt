Go  has 25 keywords like if and switch that may be used only where the 
syntax permits; they can't be used as names.

break       default         func      interface     select
case        defer           go        map           struct
chan        else            goto      package       switch
const       fallthrough     if        range         type
continue    for             import    return        var

A name begins with a letter or an underscore and may have any number of 
additional letters, digits and underscores. Case matters.


In addition there are about three dozen predeclared names like int and true
for built-in constants, typesand functions:
  Constants:    true   false   iota   nil

  Types:      int  int8 int16 int32 int64  uint  uint8  uint16  uint32
  uint64  uintptr  float32  float64  complex128  complex64  bool  byte  rune  string  error  

  Functions:  make  len  cap  new  append  copy  close  delete  complex  real  imag  
  panic  recover

These names are not reserved, so you may use them in declarations as 
identifiers.
