There's a lot more to Go than we've covered in this quick introduction. 
Here are some topics we've barely touched upon or omitted entirelym with 
just enough dicussion that they will be familiar when they make brief
appearances before the full treatment.

Control flow: 
  - regular, if, for and switch statements

Named types:
  - a type declaration makes it possible to give a name to an existing type

Pointers:
  - references to variables in the computer memory access

Methods and interface:
  - a method is a function associated with a named type
  - interfaces are abstract types that let us treat different concrete 
  types in the same way based on what methods they have associated with 
  them.

Packages:
  - standard library with many useful packages
  - Go community creates and shares more and more packages
  - packages are organized folders of code contained by modules
  - the module folder can also be a package (most commonly "main")
  - programming is often about using exisiting packages than writing your 
  own

Comments:
  - comments are important because they are used by tools like "go doc" 
  and "godoc.org" to locate and display documentation (of your packages)
  - code that is ignored by the compiler
